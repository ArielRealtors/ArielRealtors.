title: How To Invest in Real Estate in Your 20s Twenties
excerpt: And that ladies and gentlemen is how you start owing real estate in your
  twenties!

If there is one major challenge with the average Millenial, it is the preoccupation with being barely able to have a savings or investment in their twenties.

So many working-class Millenials are so caught up in living paycheck to paycheck that they barely can get by once their last paychecks are exhausted.

What I find however interesting is that the typical African working-class Millenial is still enjoying a lot of buffers that their Western counterparts cannot relate to. For example, they enjoy free accommodation by living with their parents while they work. They barely pay for their meals as their parents are kind enough to watch their kids go hungry just because these kids are now working. They are barely paying utility bills because the majority of them still have parents that are working-class citizens and who do not mind picking the tab for most of the bills at home. We are generally very liberal and generous people as Africans.

And the icing on the cake is that you do not have a burden of student debts drowning you out of the surface of the earth such that as you work, your debts are being collected.
